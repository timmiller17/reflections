When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	There are a few obvious reasons.  One, it provides a second location for project safety.  It'd be horrible
	if you lost your local storage and your code.  Two, for me personally, it allows me to work on different computers
	and keep them all in sync with my latest efforts (upstairs, downstairs, laptop on train, etc.).  Three,
	it allows you to collaborate with others which is critical for most serious personal projects and definitely for 
	professional projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Since we are talking about code here, you have to pull in complete logical 
	sets or else you will probably break the code.  Also, obviously, if multiple 
	people are working with the same remote then you don't want to be having 
	their code show up all willy-nilly in yours.  You want to merge at the 
	appropriate times.
