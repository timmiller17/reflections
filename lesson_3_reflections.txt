When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	There are a few obvious reasons.  One, it provides a second location for project safety.  It'd be horrible
	if you lost your local storage and your code.  Two, for me personally, it allows me to work on different computers
	and keep them all in sync with my latest efforts (upstairs, downstairs, laptop on train, etc.).  Three,
	it allows you to collaborate with others which is critical for most serious personal projects and definitely for 
	professional projects.
